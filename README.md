# Pong Pickup Pro

Pong Pickup Pro is a robot designed to make your table tennis practice sessions more efficient and enjoyable! This autonomous robot detects and collects table tennis balls from a small area, eliminating the need for manual collection and reducing the risk of back problems associated with bending down.

## How It Works

The robot navigates its environment, detects table tennis balls, and collects them. It can then return the balls to a basket or, using its innovative fan system, levitate them one by one to waist height for easy collection by the user. If the user does not retrieve the ball after a certain amount of time, the robot will automatically lower it back into its collection bin.

## Contributions

In this group project, I was responsible for researching and developing the fan-based ball retrieval system. Additionally, I designed and 3D printed all custom components to build the robot and configured the power supply to ensure reliable operation of all integrated hardware.
